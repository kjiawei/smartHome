    tcprecvdata and connectserverbyip
      old return value: result=1 for success, result != 1 fail
      new return value: result=0 for success, result != 0 fail, return the error code

     new method: write to file once recv a certain bytes file buff, eg. 128KB buff size
  * storage client and storage server send file method change 
     old method: get the whole file content/buff, then send to storage server
     new method: send file to storage server more times. get a certain bytes file buff, then send to storage server
